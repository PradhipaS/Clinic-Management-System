# Clinic-Management-System
Clinic Management System – Console-Based Application using Core Java &amp; OOPS- Developed during my Placement training
This project aims to build a menu-driven console application to help clinic administrators manage patient records efficiently. It leverages Core Java and Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts including inheritance, abstraction, encapsulation, and method overriding.

🛠️ Key Functionalities:
The application allows the Admin to:

Register New Patients – Capture patient details including name, age, treatment, and consultation charge.

View All Patient Records – Display a list of all registered patients with complete information.

Update Treatment Details – Modify the treatment and charge for a specific patient.

Display Patient Bill – Show the total consultation charge for an individual patient.

Exit Application – Gracefully terminate the application.
